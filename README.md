## Description
- Time: it took me 20 minutes to research about Typescript and 20 minutes to find the solution.
- Feelings: I find the test good enough for beginner like me to find the solution in a reasonable time.
- Lacking in task definition: because it is represented like a txt file so it is hard to read at first.
- Solution: my solution is complete but it is not optimized yet. First I thought I would create a function that can be overloaded to accept different kind of variable type.
